# Work Day Scheduler
## Calendar Description
The purpose of this project was to create a calendar that the user can save hourly tasks to. The calendar uses local storage to store the user inputed text and display it even if the user refreshes the page. This application uses jquery to store and dynamically update the web page. This application also uses dayjs functionality to display the current time and date as well as get the current time to change the styling of the callendar boxes.


## Lessons Learned
Our recent delve into jquery and this assignment in specific have taught me the value of jquery. The last project took me days to complete where as this only took me about a day. Looking back I realize I could have cut the time I spent on the last project in half atleast if I were using jquery. Jquery feels a lot more intuitive than vanila js.
